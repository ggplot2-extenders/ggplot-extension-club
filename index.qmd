Welcome to ggplot2 extenders/ggplot2 extension club. This forum exists to facilitate conversations about experiences with extension. We like to talk about motivations, challenges, equivocations â€” in general, extension journeys!

Our main activities are [meetings](./meetings.html) and [discussions](./discussion.html).

Note that the extension ecosystem is extensive and other initiatives exist to support extenders, check out our incomplete list of unaffliated [resources](./additional-resources.html)
