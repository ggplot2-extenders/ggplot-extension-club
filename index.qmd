Welcome to ggplot2 extenders/ggplot2 extension club. This forum exists to facilitate conversations about experiences with extension. We like to talk about motivations, challenges, equivocations — in general, extension journeys!

Our main activities are [meetings](./meetings.html) and [discussions](./discussion.html).

-   *It is fantastic to hear developers speaking directly to other developers.* - W. Joel Schneider, author of {arrowheadr}

-   *It's been great getting more involved in the extensions community, thanks for creating a place for us all to congregate!* William Gearty - {deeptime}

-   *Participating has been one of the highlights of my year.* - Joyce Robbins, ggplot2 enthusiast and instructor 


-   *It's extremely gratifying to be able to connect with and learn from people who share this still somewhat niche interest in grammatical / algebraic statistical software design.* - Cory Brunson, Author of {ggalluvial} and {ordr}




-   *I had a lot of fun at last week's meeting!* – Matthew Kay, author of {ggblend}, {ggdist}




-   *Great effort \[is put into\] organising all the meetings and inviting people.* - Teun van den Brand, author of {ggh4x}, {legendry}, ggplot2 maintainer
