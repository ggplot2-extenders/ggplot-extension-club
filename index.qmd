Welcome to ggplot2 extenders/ggplot2 extension club! This forum exists to facilitate conversations about experiences with extension. We like to talk about motivations, challenges, equivocations â€” in general, extension journeys!

Our main activities are [meetings](/meetings.html) (virtual) and [discussion](/discussion.html) (in our github repo).

Note that the extension ecosystem is extensive and other initiatives exist to support extenders. Of note is the [ggplot2 extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) tidyverse website, whose focus is to make it easy for R users to find extensions.
