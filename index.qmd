Welcome to ggplot2 extenders (aka ggplot extension club)! This forum exists to facilitate conversations about experiences with extension. We like to talk about motivations, challenges, equivocations --- in general extension journeys!

Here are some opportunities to get involved

1.  [Meetings](/meetings.html) (virtual)
2.  [Discussion](/discussion.html) (github repo discussions)
3.  Workshops? (coming soon)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that the extension ecosystem is extensive and other initiatives exist to support extenders and use of ggplot2 extensions. Of note is the [ggplot2 extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) tidyverse website. The focus of that initiative is to make it easy for R users to find extensions.
